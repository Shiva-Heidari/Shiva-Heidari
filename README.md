# üëã Hi, I'm Shiva Heidari

I am a Research Scientist with a Ph.D. in Condensed Matter Physics, currently transitioning into the quantum computing industry. My expertise lies in modeling quantum and semiconductor devices, quantum coherence, and quantum transport in real materials. I have led several simulation-driven research projects that bridge theoretical physics with experimental challenges, from topological superconductors to quantum coherence in device environments.

Here on GitHub, I am building a portfolio of quantum computing projects using **Qiskit** and **QuTiP**, showcasing my hands-on work in:

- Quantum circuit modeling and state analysis  
- Decoherence simulation in superconducting qubits 
- Gate fidelity and qubit reliability under noise  
- Hardware-aware transpilation and layout visualization  
- Translating physical intuition into simulation-driven insight

I am passionate about turning theory into practical tools and code that help advance next-generation quantum hardware.


## Projects in Progress

- **Trotter Simulation of Superconducting Qubits**  
  Digitally simulate 2- and 3-qubit superconducting systems using second-order Trotter-Suzuki decomposition. Analyze unitary dynamics, entanglement entropy growth, and fidelity against exact evolution.

- **Decoherence Simulation using QuTiP**  
  Model open quantum systems and extract T‚ÇÅ and T‚ÇÇ times in the presence of noise. Includes comparison between Lindblad and TLS-based decoherence models.

- **Quantum Teleportation with Qiskit**  
  Demonstrates ideal and noisy quantum teleportation protocols with fidelity analysis across various error models and backends.

- **Hardware-Aware Circuit Mapping**  
  Simulate and visualize transpilation of quantum circuits onto real hardware (e.g., Sherbrooke, Toronto) and fake backends (e.g., Athens, Jakarta). Analyze circuit depth, coupling maps, and noise-aware layout strategies.

- **Two-Level System (TLS) Noise Modeling** _(in progress)_  
  Simulate how TLS-induced fluctuations affect superconducting qubit coherence using QuTiP. Compare TLS vs. Lindblad models for realistic noise simulation.

- **Gate Fidelity under Realistic Noise** _(planned)_  
  Analyze quantum gate performance in the presence of measurement and decoherence noise. Compute process fidelity and visualize gate robustness across devices.


I am also developing a habit of publishing my work openly and contributing to accessible, educational quantum computing content.
