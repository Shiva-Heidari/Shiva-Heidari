# üëã Hi, I'm Shiva Heidari

I am a Research Scientist with a Ph.D. in Condensed Matter Physics, currently transitioning into the quantum computing industry. My expertise lies in modeling quantum and semiconductor devices, quantum coherence, and quantum transport in real materials. I have led several simulation-driven research projects that bridge theoretical physics with experimental challenges, from topological superconductors to quantum coherence in device environments.

Here on GitHub, I am building a portfolio of quantum computing projects using **Qiskit** and **QuTiP**, showcasing my hands-on work in:

- Quantum circuit modeling and state analysis  
- Decoherence simulation in superconducting qubits 
- Gate fidelity and qubit reliability under noise  
- Hardware-aware transpilation and layout visualization  
- Translating physical intuition into simulation-driven insight

I am passionate about turning theory into practical tools and code that help advance next-generation quantum hardware.


## Projects in Progress

- **Decoherence Simulation** using QuTiP  
- **Quantum Teleportation with Qiskit** (ideal + noisy protocol)  
- **Hardware-Aware Circuit Mapping**  (coming soon)
  - Simulated transpilation on fake backends (Brisbane, Athens, Yorktown)  
  - Real-device transpilation on IBM backends (e.g., Sherbrooke)  
  - Visualization of physical qubit layouts and circuit depth comparisons  
- **Two-Level System (TLS) Noise Modeling** *(coming soon)*  
- **Gate Fidelity Simulation under Noise** *(planned)*  

I am also developing a habit of publishing my work openly and contributing to accessible, educational quantum computing content.
