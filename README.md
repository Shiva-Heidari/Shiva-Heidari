# 👋 Hi, I'm Shiva Heidari

I'm a Research Scientist with a Ph.D. in Condensed Matter Physics, currently transitioning into the quantum computing industry. My background focuses on modeling superconducting qubits, coherence dynamics, and quantum transport in real materials. I've led several simulation-driven research projects bridging theoretical physics and experimental challenges from topological superconductors to quantum coherence in device environments.

Here on GitHub, I'm building a portfolio of quantum computing projects using **Qiskit** and **QuTiP**, showcasing my hands-on work in:

- Quantum circuit modeling and state analysis
- Decoherence simulation (T1, T2, TLS noise)
- Gate fidelity and qubit reliability under noise
- Translating real physics into simulation-driven insight

I'm passionate about turning theory into practical tools and code that help advance next-generation quantum hardware.


## What I'm Working On

- **T1 and T2 Decoherence Simulation** using QuTiP  
- **Quantum Teleportation with Qiskit** (ideal + noisy protocol)  
- **Two-Level System (TLS) Noise Modeling** (coming soon)  
- **Gate Fidelity Simulation under Noise** (planned)  
- Building habits of publishing in public and contributing to open science
